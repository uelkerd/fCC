        <h2 class="section-heading">The Life of Marie Curie</h2>
        <p>
          Marie Skłodowska Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French
          physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on
          radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first
          person and only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only
          person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Marie Curie's contributions to science have been immeasurable. She not
          only discovered two new elements and developed the theory of
          radioactivity, but she also broke gender barriers in the scientific
          community. The Curie Institute in Paris and Warsaw continues her work
          to this day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her dedication to science came at a high personal cost—she eventually
          died from aplastic anemia, likely caused by exposure to radiation.
          Despite the dangers, she never lost her determination to advance
          scientific knowledge. Her notebooks are still radioactive to this day
          and are kept in lead-lined boxes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
          Born Maria Skłodowska in Warsaw, Poland, she moved to Paris to study
          physics and mathematics at the University of Paris. There she met her
          husband, Pierre Curie, with whom she shared her Nobel Prize in
          Physics. After his tragic death in 1906, she took his place as
          Professor of General Physics in the Faculty of Sciences, becoming the
          first woman to hold this position.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marie Curie raised their two daughters as a single mother. Her eldest
          daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, also became a scientist and was awarded
          the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, continuing her mother's legacy.
